1. Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, hashCode() must 
consistently return the same value, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. 
This value needs not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application
2. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode() method on each of the two 
objects must produce the same value
3. It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the 
hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, developers should be aware that 
producing distinct integer results for unequal objects improves the performance of hash tables
