1. public static <T> List<T> asList(T... a)
Returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array. (Changes to the returned list "write through" to the array.) This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs, in combination with Collection.toArray(). The returned list is serializable and implements RandomAccess.
This method also provides a convenient way to create a fixed-size list initialized to contain several elements:

     List<String> stooges = Arrays.asList("Larry", "Moe", "Curly");

     Well this is because ArrayList resulting from Arrays.asList() is not of the type java.util.ArrayList . Arrays.asList() 
     creates an ArrayList of type java.util.Arrays$ArrayList which does not extend java.util.ArrayList but only extends java.
     util.AbstractList
