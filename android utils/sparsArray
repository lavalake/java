SparseArrays map integers to Objects.  Unlike a normal array of Objects,
26 * there can be gaps in the indices.  It is intended to be more memory efficient
27 * than using a HashMap to map Integers to Objects, both because it avoids
28 * auto-boxing keys and its data structure doesn't rely on an extra entry object
29 * for each mapping.
