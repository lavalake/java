An entry in a <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> will automatically be removed when
 * its key is no longer in ordinary use.
 Like most collection classes, this class is not synchronized.
 * A synchronized <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> may be constructed using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.
