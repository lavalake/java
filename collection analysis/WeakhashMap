An entry in a <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> will automatically be removed when
 * its key is no longer in ordinary use.
 Like most collection classes, this class is not synchronized.
 * A synchronized <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> may be constructed using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.
 Each key object in a <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> is stored indirectly as
 * the referent of a weak reference.  Therefore a key will automatically be
 * removed only after the weak references to it, both inside and outside of the
 * map, have been cleared by the garbage collector.
