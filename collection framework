Map
  why entrySet()?
  why static interface Map.Entry
Stack:
  why Stack is not an interface?
 
Implementation:
1. HashSet
  This class implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance)?
2. TreeSet
  A NavigableSet implementation based on a TreeMap
3. LinkedHashSet
  Hash table and linked list implementation of the Set interface, with predictable iteration order. This implementation differs from HashSet in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through all of its entries. This linked list defines the iteration ordering, 
  which is the order in which elements were inserted into the set (insertion-order).
