objects in Java are created on the heap
As stated by Java documentation, weak references are most often used to implement canonicalizing mappings. A mapping is called 
canonicalized if it holds only one instance of a particular value. Rather than creating a new object, it looks up the existing 
one in the mapping and uses it.
Of course, the most known use of these references is the WeakHashMap class. Itâ€™s the implementation of the Map interface where 
every key is stored as a weak reference to the given key. When the Garbage Collector removes a key, the entity associated with 
this key is deleted as well.
Another area where they can be used is the Lapsed Listener problem.
