WeakHashMap as an Efficient Memory Cache
Let’s say that we want to build a cache that keeps big image objects as values, and image names as keys. We want to pick a proper map implementation for solving that problem.

Using a simple HashMap will not be a good choice because the value objects may occupy a lot of memory. What’s more, they’ll never be reclaimed from the cache by a GC process, even when they are not in use in our application anymore.
